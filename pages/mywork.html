        <h3>Gartner: Startup Tech CEO Team (AI Strategy)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="work-content">
         <div class="work-content">
            <p><strong>Highlights</strong>
       <ul>
          <li>Advised startup and tech CEOs on AI strategy in Gartner’s High-Tech Innovation practice.</li>
         <li><strong>Focused on the dual imperative of AI: </strong>embedding it into core business strategy and operation for growth while establishing governance and risk mitigation to ensure responsible, sustainable innovation.</li>
         <li><strong>Authorship: </strong>Authored and co-authored published research on AI native leadership, outcome ownership in AI solution delivery, AI risk analysis and mitigation, and AI native business models.</li>
         <li><strong>Conferences: </strong>Represented Gartner at major conferences (AI & Big Data Expo North America, Ai4), engaging with industry leaders and conducting interviews for further use in research. </li>
         <li><strong>Executive client engagement: </strong> presenting a webinar on my AI Native Leadership framework (Dec 4, 2025) and co-hosted  inquiry calls, including with fortune 500 brands. </li>
         <li><strong>AI Pilots: </strong>Pioneered new AI applications for both research and operations, including creating an interview sentiment analysis research methodology and an AI sales training tool. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Learned how organizations at the cutting edge of AI make strategic decisions, and where those strategies often fail when translated into practice.</li>
            <li>Sharpened skills in designing research processes, synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data, and communicating complex findings to non-technical audiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Highlighted the implementation gap: </strong>I created and advised on frameworks, but I wasn’t building or testing solutions myself. I realized I wanted to prototype and evaluate systems directly while being able to own my ideas and develop them. </li>

        <h3>Beyond Exorcism: Novel Understandings of Mental Illness Through Catholic Art</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="work-content">
         <p><strong>Highlights</strong>
       <ul>
          <li>Awarded the <i>Amici di Via Gabina Fellowship</i> to conduct an independent project on portrayals of mental illness in Catholic art in Rome. Awarded Best Research Findings at the Rice University School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Research Symposium.</li>
          <li>Investigated how the behaviors of Catholic saints, many of which meet modern diagnostic criteria, were venerated rather than pathologized in a religious context.</li>
          <li>Designed and executed the project independently, drafting grant proposals, managing budget, and completing field research.</li>
          <lil>Collaborated with Dr. Renée Rosfort, Director of the University of Copenhagen Kierkegaard Institute, to formalize and refine findings.</lil>
          <li>Argued that mental illness reflects both objective symptoms/behaviors and subjective social categorization with religious framing  transforming “illness” into authority and piety.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Deepened my passion for designing research projects from scratch and drawing connections across disciplines.</li>
            <li>Showed me the power of societal norms in shaping diagnoses, revealing how psychiatry can reinforce or challenge power structures.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Connection:</strong> As we build artificial minds, we must ensure they don’t simply replicate social biases or enforce norms that marginalize vulnerable groups. Guiding AI’s emerging “theory of mind” responsibly requires an even greater rigor than we apply when questioning our own assumptions.</li>
