      <h3>Selected Gartner Research</h3>
      <p>While full articles are only available to Gartner clients, summaries for my most relevant research are below.</p>
      <p><strong>AI-Native Leadership: The Blueprint for Disruptive Growth</strong></p>
      <p>Pace-setting tech CEOs scale with a new leadership playbook rooted in a deep understanding of how AI turns massive amounts of data and information into insights that drive powerful outcomes, deliver high growth velocity and create durable competitive moats.</p>
      <p><strong>Break Through Barriers: Digital Humans Redefine Neurodivergent Engagement</strong></p>

      <p><strong>The Dark Side of AI: Without Restraint a Perilous Liability</strong></p>
      <p>AI innovation is moving too fast for most companies to control. The same technology unlocking exponential growth is already causing reputational and business damage to companies and leadership that underestimate its risks. Tech CEOs must decide what guardrails they will use when automating with AI.</p>
      <p><strong>Rise of the Machine - Create Limitless Revenue Opportunities</strong></p>
      <p>A groundbreaking business model shift is disrupting volatile B2B markets. Huge investments and valuations are flowing to tech CEOs replacing task-oriented software tools with automated, outcome-based services that meet buyer demand for end-to-end solutions that reduce cost and risk. The AI Race is on.</p>
      <p><strong>Win the War for Talent Through an Improved Digital Presence</strong></p>
      <p>Hiring top talent in a competitive landscape with skills shortages and gaps is critical for startup tech CEOs growing their businesses. This research guides startup tech CEOs in creating an authentic and engaging digital presence to drive recruitment and foster human connection amid AI-generated content.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Exorcism: Novel Understandings of Mental Illness Through Catholic Art </h3>
      <p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BymoEoxjJiEASsHsvbcEOBfe9ui5-EG/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Poster</a> & <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HvmEW_cA0hGPDSc_DDJ76QCxsJIDX7-c/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Abstract </a> </p>
      <p>This grant-funded project examined portrayals of saints in Catholic art who exhibited behaviors consistent with modern mental health diagnoses. By situating these portrayals in their socio-cultural context, I argued that the line between pathology and normalcy is socially contingent, heavily shaped by both societal norms and biology.</p>
      <p><strong>Supporting Classwork- </strong> <i><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1le6OznOdFmlqKkYYsg9VwLJ_djwtzjkG/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Between the Lines: Approaches to Defining and Treating Mental Illness</a></i></p>
      <p>This essay laid the theoretical groundwork for my research poster, introducing a framework that distinguishes ambiguous vs. unambiguous mental illness. It argues that unambiguous cases benefit most from biological approaches, while ambiguous ones require phenomenological and patient-centered care.</p>

      <h3>Cats: Journey to the First Word (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PFHa9dT07CPEtUNp34A3QpWcP-Dix1Ua/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Danish Preschool Practicum Case Study</a>)</h3>
      <p>During a semester in Copenhagen, I observed the linguistic and social development of “Maria,” a Ukrainian refugee child navigating Danish, English, and Ukrainian. Her struggles and progress highlighted both the strengths and risks of Denmark’s socio-cultural model of early education. This practicum showed me how cultural context, inclusion, and pedagogy shape development. It greatly influenced my interest in culturally aware robots for caregiving. </p>

      <h3>Relevant Course Work</h3>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADhuJTn95IfcDumRrzISXuajV4LBsEtq/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Multi-Car Uncontrolled Surface Lot Pay Station (HCI Project)</a></p>
        <p>Applied Human-Computer Interaction methods (prototyping, task analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing) to design a parking lot pay station. Though the domain is parking, the project demonstrates rigorous application of usability engineering and my ability to translate human needs into system design.</p>
     <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h2hEqyn9-r4Rjn_5G9CDfrlmcA_Evi9S/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Modeling Automatic Spreading Activation Theory of Semantic Priming</a>)</p>
    <p>Developed a MATLAB model simulating semantic priming effects, extending Annette de Groot’s work. The project tested the validity of using cognitive distance as a metric for spreading activation, revealing both strengths and limitations. This work highlights my capacity to bridge cognitive theory with computational modeling.</p>
