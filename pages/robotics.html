        <h1>Humanoid Robot Cultural Awareness: Methods and Experience</h1>

        <p class="section-focus">
            <strong>Proposed PhD Research Focus:</strong> Developing and validating a training protocol to develop sociocultural awareness in humanoid robots. This facilitates robot adaptation to the microculture of the environments they are deployed into, allowing them to respond to real-time, context-dependent social cues, increasing their efficacy overall, but especially for caregiving for vulnerable, diverse populations.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                My interest is rooted in witnessing caregiving crises (my grandmother’s stroke, assisting a child with severe leukodystrophy) which exposed the limits of human endurance in providing sensitive, non-stop care. A successful caregiving robot must manage physically demanding tasks while understanding a family's unique <strong>microculture</strong> (authority, communication norms, faith). The following three phase approach directly ties my background to the skills necessary to design this complex socio-technical solution, using a home robot as an example.

            <h2>Phase I: Define and Operationalize "Microculture"</h2>
            <p class="section-focus">
                Goal for this Phase: Establish a framework for translating abstract cultural norms into behavioral parameters for robot training.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Defining and Evaluating Microculture</h3>
            <p>
                I define "microculture awareness" as the robot’s ability to assess, quantify, and respond with adaptive behavior to the unique sociocultural environment into which it is deployed. The goal is to make robots more effective, increase human acceptance, and ensure the technology preserves existing cultural differences rather than forcing conformity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will structure my microculture analysis by applying traditional macro-culture components to the familial scale: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authority and Governance:</strong> Defines who holds authority, how decisions are made, and crisis escalation.</li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic Norms:</strong> Verbal (e.g., Spanglish, slang) and nonverbal language (ex: body language, non-verbal norms), and a sentiment analysis of household conversations to capture context-specific meanings.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditions, Routine, and Faith:</strong> Understanding the household's unique schedule, specific needs, and faith practices, including when and how the robot should engage or step back from sensitive areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Socialization Rules:</strong> Implicit rules governing respect, conflict resolution, and the balance between authority deference and independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress Response:</strong> Accounting for how the family responds to stress and change, particularly in high-demand caregiving contexts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase II: Protocol Design, Prototyping, and Validation</h2>
            <p class="section-focus">
                Goal for this Phase: Design, prototype, test and iterate the robot's culturally sensitive interaction strategy (post training protocol) using human factors methods.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Training Protocol Design</h3>
            <p>
                The protocol will be grounded in established cognitive and human developmental theory. Specifically, I plan to base the sociocultural awareness training protocol on human child developmental stages (e.g., Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development), treating robot training as an early childhood stage of learning about the world. This strategy is directly inspired by existing robotics research that bases world models on Piaget’s stages, and it aligns with my goal of treating robot training as an early childhood stage in which the robots learn about the world around them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design process hinges on my interdisciplinary background, integrating both cognitive theory and technical expertise.

            <p class="section-focus">
                Goal for this Phase: Ensure my training protocol is ethical with a formal governance framework for deployment in vulnerable, private social settings.

            <h3>Protection of Human Dignity and Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Deployment in sensitive caregiving scenarios demands strict governance to ensure the robot is an asset and not a liability. My protocol will address protection in three critical areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical Delegation and Safety:</strong> Defining what decisions should never be left to a robot, and must be made by a human caregiver or medical professional. The robot must also have crisis escalation protocols, such as mandatory reporting or calling 911.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy and Patient Dignity:</strong> Since caregiving scenarios involve sensitive data (like video/audio of private situations, potentially including nudity), the system must be built for privacy protection (such as complete anonymization of necessary recordings and mandatory data deletion). It must also empower users with full authority of their data’s storage and usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance Foundation:</strong> The framework must include rigorous guardrails, stop gaps, and transparency checkpoints to mitigate risk and protect human agency.</li>
